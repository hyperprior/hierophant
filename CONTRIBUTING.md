To get started with development, you'll need to set up your local environment. We've provided a Makefile to automate this process. Simply clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, and run:

```sh
make setup
```

This command will install all the necessary dependencies and set up the environment for you. Please note that you'll need to have make installed on your system to use this command.
